# ðŸ›’ Large-Scale Online Retail Sales Data Analysis

This project focuses on performing large-scale data analysis on **online retail sales data**. I begin by analyzing **5 million transactions** using **pandas**, and then demonstrate how we can significantly speed up the analysis using **[fireducks](https://github.com/duckdblabs/fireducks)** â€” a compiler-accelerated dataframe library that is fully compatible with the pandas API.
